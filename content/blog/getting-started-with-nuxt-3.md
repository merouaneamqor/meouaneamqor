Nuxt 3 is the latest version of the popular Vue.js framework, offering improved performance, smaller bundle sizes, and an enhanced developer experience. In this post, we'll walk through the process of setting up a new Nuxt 3 project and explore some of its key features.

## Setting Up Your Nuxt 3 Project

To get started with Nuxt 3, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Once you have Node.js, you can create a new Nuxt 3 project using the following command:

npm install
